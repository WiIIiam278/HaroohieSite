                    with
                    sound emulation on iOS as RetroArch primarily supports DeSmuME for DS emulation and the MelonDS core

                <p>There are two methods for doing this. The first method is recommended and uses Cydia Impactor to

                    the RetroArch IPA to your macOS device. For users who have a modern Mac handy that is capable of
                    running
                    XCode, there's also an alternative method involving building RetroArch with XCode and loading it
                    onto
                    your device, though it's a bit more complicated.</p>
