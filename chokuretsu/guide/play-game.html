                <li>Windows, macOS or Linux computer</li>
                <li>Nintendo DS or DS lite console</li>

            </ul>
            <b>Setup:</b>

                <li>Dump your Nintendo DS firmware, bios7 and bios9 using your flash cartridge. This <a

                        <li>Load the DS firmware dumper .nds file onto your flash cartridge's memory in the correct spot
                            using its' SD card or connector cable.
                        </li>
                        <li>Insert the flash cartridge into your Nintendo DS console.</li>
                        <li>Turn on your system and run the <code>dsbf_dump.nds</code> application</li>
                        <li>Wait for the firmware dump to complete. Then, power off your Nintendo DS, remove the cart
                            and insert the flash cart's SD card into your computer (or connect it with the correct
                            cable).
                        </li>
                        <li>Your flash cartridge's SD card/storage will now contain <code>BIOSNDS7.ROM</code>, <code>BIOSNDS9.ROM</code>
                            and a <code>.BIN</code> file starting with the letters "FW". These are your Nintendo DS'
                            ARM7 and ARM9 BIOS files and its firmware respectively.
                        </li>

                    to.
                </li>
                <li>Open melonDS, then on the top bar menu click "Config" <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> "Emu

                </li>

                </li>
                <li>On each of the required BIOS and firmware files, select the ARM7 <code>.ROM</code>, ARM9
                    <code>.ROM</code> and firmware <code>.BIN</code> files you ripped from your system.
                </li>

            <b>Playing the game:</b>
            <p>With melonDS setup, all you need to do in order to play the game is select "File" <i

            <div class="notice-box"><i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i>&nbsp;You may experience issues with
                sound emulation on iOS as RetroArch primarily supports DeSmuME for DS emulation and the MelonDS core is
                not yet stable enough to use.
            </div>
            <p>The best option for emulating on iOS and Apple TV devices is using RetroArch using the DeSmuME emulation
                core. You don't need a jailbroken device to run RetroArch (although it is easier if you have one)</p>
            <p>There are two methods for doing this. The first method is recommended and uses Cydia Impactor to transfer
                the RetroArch IPA to your macOS device. For users who have a modern Mac handy that is capable of running
                XCode, there's also an alternative method involving building RetroArch with XCode and loading it onto
                your device, though it's a bit more complicated.</p>

                </li>
                <li>Transfer the patched ROM over to your device using a third party tool such as iFunBox or iExplorer.
                    If you're running on an Apple TV, you'll be given a Web URL you can access locally to transfer ROMs
                    to the emulator directly.

            </ol>

            <h4>Emulate on Android</h4>

                which has a great interface and is simple to install, but it costs $4.99. <a

                        target="_blank">RetroArch</a> is a free alternative, although it comes with the caveat of the
                DS emulation being based on DeSmuME, which has issues emulating sound.</p>
            <b>Requirements:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Android Device with the Google Play store</li>
                <li>Drastic ($4.99) or RetroArch (free)</li>

            <p>If you own a Wii U console, Nintendo's official Virtual Console DS emulator provides accurate emulation,

                this game.</p>
            <p>To do this, you'll need to homebrew your Wii U, use UWUVCI to convert the ROM into a WUP (Wii U title)
                and then install it to your system using WUP Installer GX2.</p>
            <b>Requirements:</b>
